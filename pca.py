# Notes:
# 1. two methods: maximizing variance formulation OR minimizing error formulation (both yield same algorithm)
# 2. Should include an option to have user defined number of PCs OR choose ideal number of PCs from the data
# 3. PCA can be used for the compression of a dataset, for data preproccessing (in which data is normalizated
# and de-correlated, and it can be used in data visualization. My class must have all these!
# 4. I should include a derivation of the mathematical logic, following bishop, in Github (mostly as not to myself
# and coolness factor).
# 5. I should include an option of "probabilistic PCA", this probably helps with choosing the number of dimensions
# when reducing dimensionality
# ---> But this will need an EM algorithm
